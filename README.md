# Automated-Directory-Struture

- Developed a C program to automate directory structure migration from a legacy server to a modern Linux server.

- Created virtual directories based on text file entries, dynamically generating user-specific profiles with timestamps. Set read-only permissions for profile.txt files to ensure data integrity.

- Implemented logging to document operations with timestamps and displayed real-time console messages.
